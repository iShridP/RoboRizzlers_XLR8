RoboRizzlers XLR8

Stuff that made us different:

1. We destroyed a Rpi Pico (obliterated).

2. We worked on AUV project, integrating a sound system buzzer into it.

3. We totally rewrote the diffrential mechanism code to incorporate turning and moving at the same time with controller.

4. We had to deal with both our MPU and ESP not working on two seperate occasssions ( :( ).
